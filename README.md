###Luke's Emacs configuration
This repository is for my personal use when working on different machines. It requires Emacs 24 to take advantage of the marmalade and ELPA features. There are many cool features that I have borrowed from others, but many of these are also customized to my own needs. I use this repository when working across my Windows 7, Lubuntu, Fedora, and Ubuntu 14.04 machines.

Feel free to use it, and send me a message if you have any issues.
