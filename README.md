###Luke's Emacs configuration
This repository is for my personal use when working on different machines. It requires ELPA and marmalade package managers, which I believe are standard for Emacs 24. There are some cool features that I have mostly borrowed from others, along with a few customized macros. Most of the good stuff is in `my-config.el`.

Feel free to use it, and send me a message if you have any issues.
