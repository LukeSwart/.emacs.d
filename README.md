###Luke's Evil Emacs configuration
This repository is for my personal use when working on different machines. It requires Emacs 24 to take advantage of the marmalade and ELPA features. I usually run on 24.3. There are many cool features that I have borrowed from others, but many of these are also customized to my own needs. I regularly use this repository when working across my Windows 7, Lubuntu, Fedora, and Ubuntu 14.04 machines.

I have it set up for Evil-mode, which uses Vim's keybinding interface. I also have set it up for Python development, based on [this guy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mflvdXKyA_g) awesome advice.

I encourage users to learn the setup thoroughly before simply installing this profile. Although I am happy to assist with any questions.
